# HackHazards - AI Flashcard Language Learning App

This repository contains our project developed for the **HackHazards Hackathon**, where we built an **AI-powered Flashcard Web App** designed to help users learn new languages through intelligent repetition and interactive engagement.

## 💡 Project Overview

Our app uses flashcards generated by AI to teach vocabulary, phrases, and sentence structures. Users can select a language, view flashcards, mark cards as known or unknown, and receive adaptive suggestions based on their learning patterns.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔤 **AI-Generated Flashcards** for various languages  
- 🧠 **Spaced Repetition Technique** to boost memory retention  
- ✅ Track what you’ve learned and focus on what you haven’t  
- 🌐 Simple and responsive UI for a smooth learning experience  
- 📊 Personalized recommendations (planned feature)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **AI**: GPT-based language model for flashcard content generation  
- **Storage**: Local storage (prototype) or backend session (for tracking)

## 🌟 Goals

- Make language learning fun and efficient  
- Build a smart, flashcard-based alternative to rote memorization  
- Support multiple languages with personalized experiences
